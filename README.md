*I collected some of the interviews for Javascript*

## What is currying?
It's a technique used to convert a function that takes multiple arguments to a chain of functions where every only takes one argument.
Currying is basically all about Higher Order Functions.
It's an application of Javascript's apility to return functions from other functions.

At first glance, it may look a bit weird why we ever need to call a function separating arguments.
You can think of it as a function preparation for execution. If you have some common operation such as getting an object property, you can move it to the curried version.
